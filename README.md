# Udacity - Cloud Developer NanoDegree
> Course 2 Project - WARNING! Do not attempt to build and use project.

<strong>Details</strong>: This is a revamped project showing how to migrate a monolith app to a microservice app. There was an existing repo that I had that was working but it was working half of the time. I needed more research on how to mock the app when connecting the frontend and backend through api calls.

The front end is setup differently. I am testing out how to use Ionic with React, and Expo React Native that targets the web. Unfortunately, Expo React Native current version has a bug that will not display the web verison, so I will be putting that project to the side for now.
